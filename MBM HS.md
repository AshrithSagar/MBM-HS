https://2021.igem.org/Competition/Tracks/Software

1. Transfer Github before freeze.
2. Create a judging release. Installation-ready copy.
3. Work with wet lab. Use iGEM Reddit or Twitter, if.
4. Large ambitious wet lab project that includes a lot of computational work => Make two teams.
5. use of Git/GitHub for version control is mandatory.
6. Teams should make use of the SBOL standard for synthetic biology data exchange as well as SBOL Visual.

Drones.
Carbon fiber composites.

Disadvantages of carbon fiber composite production with hot-press forming:
- High costs of production implementation.
- Difficult to make elements having so-called negative angles.

Advantages.
- ULTRA-HIGH STRENGTH
- EXTREME LIGHTWEIGHT
- NEGLIGIBLE THERMAL EXPANSION

## XML

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data.

---

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language

---

https://qr.ae/pv27zV

Keep in mind however that nowadays most file formats are xml inside…. I would thus describe format with xml terminology.

If you declare a binary file format, be sure to standardize endian, word sizes, code page etc.

---

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression

---

https://www.fileformat.info/mirror/egff/ch08_07.htm

- Study everybody else's mistakes. No matter what you think, you're not smart enough to avoid them all, unless you see them first.

- Write the format before, not after, your application. Build the application around it. Don't make convenience revisions no matter what the provocation.

---

https://qr.ae/pv2RKK

Do you want to create a format, or a standard? If you want to create a format, it’s easy. Open a file handle and start writing bits to the disk. When you are done writing bits, stop. If you would like to be able to read them back, document what each of the bits mean. (I recommend starting by choosing a format for a file header which contains the name of your new format, and perhaps a version number. You might also look at other file formats which do similar things, when deciding how to design your new format. Perhaps you want to use comma separated values, a fixed width format, or compressed XML?)

If you want other people to use your format, you need a standard. That means you need to, at a minimum, publish the format somewhere along with a justification for why the world needs your new format. Ideally, you’ll create a **reference implementation**, a piece of software which can read and write your new format. If you want *lots* of people to use it, you might try to work with a standards body to formalize and codify it, as well as to consider all the corner cases you might need to handle.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.

SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.

## Spectrophotometer

[Forwarded from RAHIL UMMAR FARUK ABBU 120165144]

> Not to decide per say, but to like say produce a graph automatically from the results
>
> For example, when you check the OD value of a sample in a spectrophotometer with respect to certain parameters (that you will input in the spectrophotometer itself) a graph will be produced (this also in spectrophotometer) , so basically for each sample (like dna) we will check the od value and get a graph. So if you can automate a software that combines all the graph and provides the average ideal graph.

https://www.bmglabtech.com/optical-density-for-absorbance-assays/

For absorbance measurements, the optical density (O.D.) is a logarithmic measurement of the percent transmission (%T) and it can be represented by the equation, $A = log_{10} 100 / \%T$.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OD600

It is a commonly used in Spectrophotometry for estimating the concentration of bacteria or other cells in a liquid as the $600nm$ wavelength does little to damage or hinder their growth.

---

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry

Spectrophotometric data can also be used in conjunction with the Beer–Lambert Equation, {\textstyle A=-\log _{10}T=\epsilon cl=OD}![{\textstyle A=-\log _{10}T=\epsilon cl=OD}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdbea05857e363ecad3a27e2f2b180e5d5e2f245), in order to determine various relationships between transmittance and concentration, and absorbance and concentration.

Because a spectrophotometer measures the wavelength of a compound through its color, a dye binding substance can be added so that it can undergo a color change and be measured.

Codonator 3000 is a web-based tool with which users can generate a codon harmonised sequences for any given input coding sequence. The tool provides an output for each of four algorithms: codon optimisation, as well as rank order, nearest frequency, and relative proportion codon harmonisation methods, the latter two of which also allow for the user to set a minimum threshold for rareness to accept in the harmonised sequence.
