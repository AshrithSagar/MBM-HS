Overview
--------

This software provides a library of miscellaneous utilities / recipes for
generic computations with Python.
It is relatively easy to extend and users are encouraged to tweak with it.

Most of the code is used in a number of projects where it is tested
against real-life scenarios.

All the code is tested against the examples in the documentation
(using `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`__).

The code has reached a reasonable level of maturity.
However, until it gets a wider adoption, some of the library components may
undergo some refactoring in the process of improving the code.
Changes will appear in the ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
Please file a bug report if you detect an undocumented refactoring.

Releases information are available through ``NEWS.rst``.

For a more comprehensive list of changes see ``CHANGELOG.rst`` (automatically
generated from the version control system).


Features
--------

The package contains a number of generic functions like

-  ``multi_replace()``: performs multiple replacements in a string.
-  ``flatten()``: recursively flattens nested iterables, e.g.
   list of list of tuples to flat list).
-  ``uniques()``: extract unique items from an iterable while
   keeping the order of appearance.

etc.

These are meant to run both in Python 3 and in PyPy.
For this reason, dependencies to external modules are kept to a minimum.
etc.
